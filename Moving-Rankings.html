 <h1>The Best Movies According to Natalie</h1>
 <h2>My all-time top 3 movies and why!</h2>
 <hr />

 <h3>The Shawshank Redemption</h3>
 <p>Honestly do I even need to explain this one...Morgan Freeman.<br />
There is just something about his voice and his acting skills.<br />
The story, the ending, I can watch this movie over and over again.</p>

<h3>Pretty Woman</h3>
<p>Julia Robert has always and will always be one of my favorite actresses.<br />
Her smile and her laugh get me every time. She's a well rounded actor.<br />
She makes you fall in love with her character in this movie.</p>

<h3>National Lampoons Christmas Vacation</h3>
<p>This one is for the nostalgia, it brings back so many great childhood<br />
memories for me. We would watch this every Christmas</p>
